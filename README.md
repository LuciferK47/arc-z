# ARC-AGI Competition: Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus for Artificial General Intelligence

## üéØ Competition Overview

This repository contains my submission for the **ARC-AGI-2** competition, which challenges AI systems to efficiently learn new skills and solve open-ended problems without relying exclusively on extensive training datasets. The competition aims to bridge the gap between current AI capabilities and human-level reasoning.

### üèÜ Prize Structure
- **Base Prize**: $125,000
- **Breakthrough Bonus**: Additional $600,000 for achieving >85% accuracy on the leaderboard
- **Total Potential**: $725,000

## üß† The Challenge

Current AI systems struggle with generalization to novel problems outside their training data. While Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at known tasks, they fall short when faced with unprecedented reasoning challenges. The ARC benchmark highlights this limitation:

- **Human Performance**: 100% accuracy
- **Best AI Systems**: Only 4% accuracy

This massive gap represents one of the most significant challenges in achieving Artificial General Intelligence (AGI).

## üìä Dataset Structure

The competition provides several data files:

### Training Data
- **`arc-agi_training-challenges.json`**: Input/output demonstration pairs for training
- **`arc-agi_training-solutions.json`**: Corresponding ground truth solutions

### Evaluation Data
- **`arc-agi_evaluation-challenges.json`**: Validation tasks with demonstration pairs
- **`arc-agi_evaluation-solutions.json`**: Corresponding ground truth solutions

### Test Data
- **`arc-agi_test-challenges.json`**: Final evaluation tasks (240 unseen tasks)
- **`sample_submission.json`**: Example submission format

## üîç Task Format

Each task consists of:

```json
{
  "train": [
    {
      "input": [[0, 1, 2], [3, 4, 5]],
      "output": [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]
    }
    // ... more demonstration pairs
  ],
  "test": [
    {
      "input": [[6, 7, 8], [9, 0, 1]]
      // output needs to be predicted
    }
  ]
}
```

### Grid Specifications
- **Format**: Rectangular matrix (list of lists)
- **Values**: Integers 0-9 (visualized as colors)
- **Size Range**: 1√ó1 to 30√ó30
- **Prediction Requirement**: Exact match (all cells must be correct)

## üéØ Evaluation Criteria

### Scoring System
- **Attempts**: 2 predictions per test input
- **Success**: Any of the 2 attempts matches ground truth exactly
- **Scoring**: Binary (1 for correct, 0 for incorrect)
- **Final Score**: Average of highest scores per task output

### Submission Format
```json
{
  "task_id": {
    "attempt_1": [[predicted_output_grid]],
    "attempt_2": [[predicted_output_grid]]
  }
}
```

**Critical Requirements:**
- All task IDs from input file must be present in submission
- Both attempt_1 and attempt_2 must be provided
- Predictions must maintain the same order as test inputs

## üöÄ Approach Strategy

The key challenges this competition addresses:

1. **Novel Problem Solving**: Tasks are completely unseen, requiring true generalization
2. **Pattern Recognition**: Identifying abstract reasoning patterns from few examples
3. **Efficient Learning**: Quick adaptation to new task types without extensive retraining
4. **Exact Precision**: Solutions must be perfectly accurate, not approximately correct

## üî¨ Research Implications

Success in this competition could lead to:
- **Breakthrough in AGI**: Moving beyond memorization toward true reasoning
- **Cross-Industry Applications**: General problem-solving capabilities
- **Human-AI Collaboration**: Systems that can think and invent alongside humans
- **Open Source Innovation**: Winning solutions will be publicly available

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Considerations

### Beyond Traditional LLMs
This competition encourages exploration of:
- Novel architectures beyond transformer models
- Few-shot learning techniques
- Meta-learning approaches
- Symbolic reasoning systems
- Hybrid neuro-symbolic methods

### Performance Benchmarks
- **Current SOTA**: ~4% accuracy
- **Human Baseline**: 100% accuracy
- **Competition Target**: 85% for maximum prize
